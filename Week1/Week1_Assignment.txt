->create a 1-line unix command that:
■ converts the original file from dos to unix format
■ finds all 6-letter words starting with “i”
■ replaces the word “intern” with your name
■ replaces all occurrences of “z” with “-”
■ arranges the words 5 per line
■ stores the result in a file

->command
dos2unix words_alpha.txt | grep -Eo '^i[a-z]{5}' words_alpha.txt | sed 's/intern/jashan/g; s/z/-/g' | xargs -n 5 >  Jashan.txt

->Output
